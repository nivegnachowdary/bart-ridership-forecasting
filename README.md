# ðŸš† BART Ridership Forecasting Using Deep Learning

### Problem
Forecasting public transit usage (BART) based on weather, holidays, and time-series data to help optimize scheduling and resource planning.

### Tools & Techniques
- Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn
- LSTM, TCN, Transformer Models
- MAE, RMSE for evaluation

### Approach
- Preprocessed multi-source ridership and weather data
- Engineered lag features and normalized time-series inputs
- Trained deep learning models to predict future ridership
- Compared results with ARIMA baseline

### Results
- LSTM/Transformer models improved accuracy by **20%**
- Reduced training time by **15%** through optimized preprocessing
- Project selected for **IEEE CAI 2025** (Short Paper)
